# Netflix Recommendation Machine Learning Project
Welcome to the Netflix Recommendation Machine Learning project repository! This project is dedicated to building an intelligent recommendation system for Netflix, employing advanced machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to enhance user experience by providing personalized suggestions for movies and TV shows based on individual viewing patterns and preferences.

My recommendation system employs sophisticated collaborative filtering techniques, leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing user interactions, ratings, and viewing history on Netflix. By analyzing collective user behavior, the system aims to make accurate predictions and deliver tailored content recommendations.
